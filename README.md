This is the official Modular Robotics (platform) repository - MRP, also as the (Visual) Robotic Tracking Platform - VRTP

The software for the VRTP is simply reffered to as the Visual Tracking System - VTS

The VRTP project aims to create a deployable people tracking and following system for robots. The current iteration of VRTP utilises a camera to track colored lights attached to the leg of the person which should be followed. The end goal is to develop a full MRP platform, i.e a full robot deploying the VRTP tracking system which can follow people.
